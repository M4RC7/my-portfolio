<p>How to get started:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You'll need GCC, such as MinGW or TDM-GCC;</li>
  <li>You may want to use an IDE, such as Code::Blocks;</li>
  <li>You may need to add a path in datapath if you want to use with command prompt;<br>
      How to access datapath: Computer-> Properties-> Advanced Config-> Environment Variables-> Path;</li>
  <li>TDM-GCC already has a built-in path in datapath writing;</li>
  <li>For use in command prompt: Compile with "g++ name -o executable" in directory. Run with "executable" in directory.</li>
</ul>
