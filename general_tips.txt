You can enter the whole directory if you're in a different directory (for instance, "C:\users\user\desktop\something.txt")
You can enter the subdirectory if you're in a higher directory (for instance, "desktop\something.txt" if you're in "C:\users\user")
Standard input and output redirections are done with '<' and '>' (for instance, "test < in.txt > out.txt")
